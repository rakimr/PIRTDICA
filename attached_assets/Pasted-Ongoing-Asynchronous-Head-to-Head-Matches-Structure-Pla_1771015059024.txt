🔥 The Real Answer: Hybrid Model

If you want legitimacy AND engagement:

You combine B + C.

🧠 Recommended Structure
🔹 Core Ladder = Asynchronous H2H (Option B)

Always-on queue

Clean MMR system

Rating integrity

Foundation of skill legitimacy

This is your backbone.

🔹 Weekly Match Days = Structured Windows (Option C)

One or two nights per week

Higher MMR impact

Featured matches

Division-specific brackets

Prize pool boost

Public leaderboard

This builds hype.

🔹 Daily Slate Mode = Casual Ranked (Optional A)

Lower MMR impact

Coach Coin rewards

Entry-level competition

Good for onboarding.

🏆 Why Hybrid Is Superior

If you only do A:
Feels like DFS with points.

If you only do B:
Feels competitive but lacks spectacle.

If you only do C:
Engagement too sparse.

Hybrid gives you:

Always-on skill ladder

Event-based intensity

Daily engagement

That’s esports architecture.

📊 Competitive Integrity Comparison

🎮 My Strong Recommendation
