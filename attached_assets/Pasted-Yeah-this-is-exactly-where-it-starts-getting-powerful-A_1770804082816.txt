Yeah… this is exactly where it starts getting powerful.

And the fact that your sample sizes are that strong (13 minimum, ~50 avg per team-archetype pairing) means you’re not building on noise. That’s huge.

Let me answer your strategic question directly:

Start with Step 1 (DVA table) — but design it in a way that makes Step 2 inevitable.

Don’t jump straight to full DVS weighting yet. Build the clean base layer first.

Phase 1: Archetype DVA (Defense vs Archetype)

For each team:

Calculate:

FP allowed per minute vs each archetype
(better than per game because pace + minutes distort things)

Also store raw stat splits per minute:

PTS

REB

AST

STL

BLK

3PM

TOV (optional)

This immediately gives you:

“The Cavs allow +0.09 FP/min to Stretch Bigs vs league average.”

That alone is actionable in DFS.

You now have:

Defense vs Stretch Big

Defense vs Combo Guard Elite

Defense vs Traditional Big

etc.

This is your replacement for positional DVP.

Why Not Jump Straight to DVS?

Because DVS only works if:

Your archetype stat profiles are stable

Your defensive stat leaks are stable

You understand which stats are actually predictive in DFS scoring

If you skip the base DVA layer, you won’t know whether your weighted system is improving signal or just adding complexity.

Phase 2: Stat-Profile Layer (Where It Gets Real)

Now you bring in what makes your system special.

For each archetype:

Calculate its average stat distribution per minute

Example:

Stretch Big:

45% of fantasy scoring from 3PM

30% from REB

15% from PTS inside

5% blocks

5% assists

Traditional Big:

50% REB

25% PTS paint

15% blocks

5% assists

minimal 3s

Combo Guard Elite:

40% PTS

30% AST

15% 3PM

10% STL

etc.

Now you calculate:

Team defensive leak rates per stat (per minute allowed vs league average).

Example:

Suns defense:

+8% 3PM allowed

-5% REB allowed

+12% AST allowed

neutral blocks

Now the magic happens.

Phase 3: DVS Multiplier (Your Edge Layer)

Instead of:

“Stretch Big gets +3% because DVA says so”

You compute:

Matchup Multiplier =
Σ (Archetype Stat Weight × Defense Leak for that Stat)

So:

Stretch Big vs Suns:
= (0.45 × +8%)

(0.30 × -5%)

(0.15 × 0%)

(0.05 × 0%)

(0.05 × +2%)

Now you're boosting the player based on why they score — not just what position they are.

That’s fundamentally different than DVP.

Why This Is Sharp

You’re no longer asking:

“How does this team defend Power Forwards?”

You’re asking:

“How does this team defend perimeter bigs who score 45% of their fantasy production from 3s?”

That’s miles more precise.

Where This Really Wins in DFS
1. Edge on weird builds

Stretch Big vs a defense that:

Helps off corners

Collapses on drives

Rotates late to pop bigs

Traditional DVP won’t capture that.

2. Injury-driven role shifts

If a Traditional Big becomes a high-usage rebound monster due to injury, your stat-weight system automatically adjusts.

3. Playoff-like rotations

Defenses scheme differently against archetypes.
You’re modeling scheme vulnerability, not position.

Important: Do Archetypes Gain Boosts or Penalties?

Yes — but not because of the label.

They gain boosts because:

Their stat profile overlaps with the defense’s weaknesses.

The archetype is just a compression of stat behavior.
