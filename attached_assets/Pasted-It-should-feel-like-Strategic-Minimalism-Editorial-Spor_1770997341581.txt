It should feel like:

📐 Strategic Minimalism
🏀 Editorial Sports Design
🧠 Analytical but bold

Think:
Nike campaign meets tech startup meets esports broadcast lower-third.

Let’s redesign the avatar direction around that.

⸻

🎨 The Correct Avatar Direction for Your UI

Since your UI is white:
	•	Heavy outlines
	•	Bold shapes
	•	High contrast
	•	Minimal color use
	•	Strong geometry
	•	Clean vector art

No gradients.
No messy detail.
No dark glowing cyber stuff.

⸻

🧱 Primary Avatar Style Recommendation

🔲 Bold Geometric Coach Icons

Flat, black vector shapes.
Strong line weight.
Minimal fill colors (accent only).

Think:
	•	Solid black silhouette
	•	One accent color stripe
	•	Clean geometric cut shapes
	•	Sharp angles
	•	Circular framing

Very editorial.
Very clean.
Very intentional.

⸻

🏆 Concrete Avatar Design Categories

Here’s a structured launch set:

⸻

1️⃣ Tactical Silhouettes (Core Line)

Minimal, bold, black shapes.

Examples:

• The Architect – Side profile coach silhouette with sharp jawline
• The Analyst – Glasses silhouette with stat-line reflection
• The General – Forward-facing strong outline
• The Silent Scout – Hooded minimalist shape
• The Strategist – Clipboard integrated into silhouette

All black vector.
Accent line in:
	•	Red
	•	Royal Blue
	•	Electric Green
	•	Gold
	•	Purple

Accent color can match division.

⸻

2️⃣ Archetype Emblem Series

Instead of faces, go symbolic.

Stretch Big → Tall rectangle + arc halo
Combo Guard → Split lightning arc
Playmaker → Circular node network
Traditional Big → Square fortress icon
Scoring Wing → Angular winged V
3-and-D Wing → Shield + arc line
Athletic Wing → Explosive triangle burst

Flat.
Bold.
Iconic.

These would look incredible on white UI.

⸻

3️⃣ Rank-Framed Avatars

Keep avatar simple.

Frame shows rank.

Bronze → Thin bronze ring
Silver → Slight thicker ring
Gold → Gold ring with notch accents
Diamond → Sharp angular diamond corners
Master → Double frame
Grandmaster → Crown cutout top
Champion → Crown integrated into top frame

The frame carries prestige.
Not over-designed faces.

⸻

4️⃣ Typography Avatars (Very Clean)

Given you use Righteous…

You can sell:
	•	Single bold initial
	•	2-letter monogram
	•	Archetype code (SB, CGE, SW)

Styled like:

Big centered letter.
Heavy black.
Thin accent line crossing through.

Minimal.
Modern.
High status.

Sometimes less is more.

⸻

🧠 Advanced Identity Concept

Instead of “avatars” being pictures…

Make them:

Identity Emblems.

Round badge style.

Like:

● Bold circle
● Strong icon in center
● Rank frame outside

Clean.
Scalable.
Professional.

⸻

🎯 Limited Edition Ideas

Seasonal Drop Example:

Season 1 – “Founders Series”
	•	Numbered badge
	•	Roman numeral I
	•	Minimal crown line

Season 2 – “Data Era”
	•	Radar sweep icon
	•	Grid overlay pattern
	•	Statistical motif

Season 3 – “Archetype War”
	•	Split badge (two archetype halves)

Keep it structured.

⸻

🧬 The Key Design Rule

Your avatars should:

Look good at 32px and 128px.
Work in leaderboard rows.
Look clean next to black text.
Not dominate the UI.

That’s critical.

⸻

💰 Monetization Structure

Tier 1 (50–100 Coins)
	•	Basic silhouettes
	•	Single color accent

Tier 2 (250–400 Coins)
	•	Dual accent
	•	Thicker line work
	•	Subtle pattern inside

Tier 3 (800–1500 Coins)
	•	Animated line sweep
	•	Dynamic stat pulse
	•	Division-reactive frame

Keep animation subtle.
White UI doesn’t handle heavy animation well.

⸻

🔥 Strongest Launch Move

If I were you:

Launch with:
	•	8 Archetype Emblems
	•	6 Tactical Silhouettes
	•	1 Founders Badge
	•	Rank-reactive frames

That’s clean.
Professional.
Esports-ready.
