Big picture (one sentence)

Minutes + rates give you the expected fantasy points.
Historical fantasy points tell you how wrong you can be.

That’s the division of labor.

What historical FP should not be used for

❌ As a straight average replacement for your projection
❌ As a shortcut around minutes + usage modeling
❌ As a black-box predictor

You already have a structural expectation. Don’t throw it away.

What historical FP is extremely good for
1️⃣ Estimating margin of error / variance

This is the biggest value.

You model the mean as:

𝜇
𝑖
=
𝑀
^
𝑖
×
FPPM
𝑖
μ
i
	​

=
M
^
i
	​

×FPPM
i
	​


Historical fantasy points give you:

𝜎
FP
,
𝑖
=
SD
⁡
(
FP
𝑖
,
𝑔
)
σ
FP,i
	​

=SD(FP
i,g
	​

)

Now you have a distribution, not just a point.

FP
𝑖
∼
𝑁
(
𝜇
𝑖
,
𝜎
FP
,
𝑖
2
)
FP
i
	​

∼N(μ
i
	​

,σ
FP,i
2
	​

)

That unlocks:

Ceilings

Floors

GPP leverage

Bust probability

2️⃣ Decomposing where volatility comes from

Fantasy-point variance comes from three sources:

Var
⁡
(
FP
)
=
Var
⁡
(
Minutes
)
+
Var
⁡
(
Rates
)
+
Cov
⁡
Var(FP)=Var(Minutes)+Var(Rates)+Cov

You already modeled:

Minutes SD

Usage-driven rate changes

Historical FP captures everything you didn’t explicitly model:

Shooting variance

Assist chain randomness

Stock volatility

Scorekeeper noise

That’s real signal.

3️⃣ Calibrating player archetypes (this is sneaky powerful)

From historical FP distributions, you can learn:

Player type	FP SD
High-usage guard	Very high
3&D wing	Low
Rebound-only big	Medium
Stocks-dependent big	Extremely high

This helps you:

Scale variance by archetype

Not overtrust high-mean players with wild outcomes

How to use historical FP correctly (important)
Step 1: De-mean the fantasy points

You don’t want raw SD — you want residual SD.

𝜀
𝑖
,
𝑔
=
FP
𝑖
,
𝑔
−
(
Min
𝑖
,
𝑔
×
FPPM
𝑖
,
𝑔
)
ε
i,g
	​

=FP
i,g
	​

−(Min
i,g
	​

×FPPM
i,g
	​

)

Then:

𝜎
𝜀
,
𝑖
=
SD
⁡
(
𝜀
𝑖
,
𝑔
)
σ
ε,i
	​

=SD(ε
i,g
	​

)

This isolates noise, not role changes.

Step 2: Rebuild total variance
𝜎

=

FPPM

⋅σ

)+(

	​

⋅σ

	​

)+σ

This is very close to how pros do it.

Using this in practice (DFS relevance)
Cash games

Prefer low σ / high μ

Historical FP SD is huge here

GPPs

Prefer high σ relative to salary

FP volatility > mean in tournaments

Why RG (and others) still show historical FP

Because it answers:

“How weird can this guy get?”

That’s not something projections alone can tell you.

One intuition to lock in

Projections are about being right on average.
Historical fantasy points are about surviving variance.

Direct answer to your question

Yes:

Historical fantasy points absolutely help compute margin of error

They should be used for variance, not the mean

They complete the model by turning point estimates into distributions
