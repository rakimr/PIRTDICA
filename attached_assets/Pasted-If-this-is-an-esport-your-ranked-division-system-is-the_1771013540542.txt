If this is an esport, your ranked division system is the backbone of legitimacy.
It needs to:

Reward skill over short-term variance

Discourage smurfing

Be transparent

Create seasonal hype

Support both free and cash ecosystems

Let’s design it properly.

🏟 Core Structure: Tiered Divisions + Hidden MMR

You should use:

Visible Rank (Division)

Hidden MMR (true skill rating)

Visible rank creates prestige.
Hidden MMR keeps matchmaking fair.

🏆 Division Ladder Structure

Keep it clean and familiar.

🔹 Bronze
🔹 Silver
🔹 Gold
🔹 Platinum
🔹 Diamond
🔹 Master
🔹 Grandmaster
🔹 Champion (Top X only)

Each division (except top tiers) has 3 sub-tiers:

Gold III

Gold II

Gold I

This creates progression friction and grind motivation.

📊 Rating System (ELO-Based, Modified for DFS)

Standard ELO is 1v1 based on win/loss.

But DFS has:

Score differentials

Projection deltas

Lineup efficiency

So we enhance it.

🧠 MMR Calculation Components

After each ranked match:

MMR Change = Base Win/Loss Value

Performance Modifier

Opponent Strength Modifier

1️⃣ Base Value

Win = +20
Loss = -20

(Adjustable based on testing)

2️⃣ Performance Modifier

Instead of pure win/loss, add:

+5 if you exceed your projection by X%
+3 if you beat opponent by large margin
-3 if you win but underperform badly

This reduces variance impact.

You reward skillful lineup construction, not luck.

3️⃣ Opponent Strength Modifier

Beat someone 300 MMR above you?
+10 bonus.

Lose to someone much stronger?
Small penalty.

This prevents ladder stagnation.

🚀 Promotion & Demotion System

To make it feel esports-like:

When entering a new division:
You must win a Promotion Series.

Example:
Gold I → Platinum III requires:
Best of 3 matches.

Lose?
Drop back slightly.

This adds intensity.

🧬 Seasonal Structure

Each season:

6–8 weeks

Soft MMR reset

Divisions partially compressed

Example:
Diamond → resets to Platinum I
Gold → resets to Gold III

Not full wipe.
Soft compression.

Prevents infinite skill inflation.

🏅 Seasonal Rewards (Important)

Rewards should scale by:

Highest division achieved, not ending division.

Example:

Gold → Gold badge
Diamond → Diamond animated frame
Grandmaster → Exclusive title
Champion → Crown icon + profile glow

Coach Coin rewards scale too.

This prevents late-season camping.

🧨 Anti-Smurf Protections

Smurfing will happen.

Countermeasures:

Rapid MMR acceleration for high win rate

Performance-based adjustments

Device fingerprint checks

Entry into cash arena locked behind minimum division (e.g., Gold+)

A new account dominating shouldn’t stay in Bronze long.

🏆 Champion Tier Design

Top 100 or Top 250 only.

Visible leaderboard

Public match history

Seasonal playoff tournament

Cash championship eligibility

This creates aspirational hierarchy.

🎮 Ranked Match Format Options

You can vary formats by division:

Lower ranks:

Standard H2H

Mid ranks:

H2H + archetype challenge modifier

High ranks:

Blind lineup lock

Opponent history visible

Match scouting

Makes higher tiers feel strategic.

📈 Division Distribution Target

Healthy competitive ladder:

Bronze: 25%

Silver: 25%

Gold: 20%

Platinum: 15%

Diamond: 8%

Master: 4%

Grandmaster: 2%

Champion: <1%

If too many reach top, prestige collapses.

🏟 Separate Ladders or Unified?

Best design:

One unified ladder.

Cash matches:

Affect MMR

But require minimum division

This keeps the esport ecosystem cohesive.

🧠 Extra Layer: Archetype Rating

Since you built archetypes…

You can track:

Stretch Big rating

Scoring Wing rating

Combo Guard rating

Display:

“Diamond Overall – Master Stretch Big Specialist”

Now your clustering model becomes competitive identity.

That’s unique.

🔥 What This System Achieves

Skill expression beyond win/loss

Controlled inflation

Seasonal hype

Smurf resistance

Prestige hierarchy

Esports legitimacy
