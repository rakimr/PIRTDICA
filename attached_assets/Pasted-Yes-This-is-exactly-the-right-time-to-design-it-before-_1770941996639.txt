Yes. This is exactly the right time to design it — before users touch it.

If the economy is wrong, everything breaks:

Too inflationary → coins become meaningless

Too restrictive → no one cares

Too pay-to-win → competitive integrity dies

Too cosmetic-only → engagement dies

You want skill-driven earnings + meaningful sinks + prestige layering.

Let’s architect this properly.

🧱 Step 1: Define What Coach Coins Actually Are

Coach Coins should be:

✔️ Earned primarily through skill
✔️ Spent on status, access, and tools
✔️ Limited in inflation
✔️ Non-transferable (initially)

Do NOT make them tradeable at first.
Marketplaces introduce exploit vectors immediately.

🏦 Step 2: The Core Economy Loop

Here’s the loop you want:

Play Ranked → Earn Coins → Spend Coins → Unlock More Competitive Play → Repeat

Not:

Play → Farm → Hoard → Nothing to spend on

💰 Step 3: Coin Sources (Controlled Inflows)

Coins should enter the system through:

1️⃣ Ranked Match Winnings

Entry Fee: 10 coins

Winner gets: 18 coins

Platform rake: 2 coins

Important:
Coins are recycled, not printed.

This is the healthiest source.

2️⃣ Seasonal Rewards

End-of-season:

Top 10% → 500 coins

Top 25% → 250 coins

Participation tier → 50 coins

This is new coin minting — must be controlled.

3️⃣ Achievement Unlocks

One-time rewards:

10 win streak → 25 coins

100 wins → 100 coins

Archetype mastery → 50 coins

One-time only.
No repeat farming.

4️⃣ Daily Skill Challenges

But structured carefully:

Must win ranked match with 3 archetypes

Must beat projection by 10%

Skill-gated.

🚿 Step 4: Coin Sinks (This Is Critical)

Without sinks, inflation kills value.

You need coins constantly leaving circulation.

🏆 1️⃣ Entry Fees (Primary Sink)

This is the most important one.
Every ranked match burns rake.

🎟 2️⃣ Tournament Buy-ins

High-stakes tournaments:

100 coin entry

Top 10% paid

Bigger buy-in = stronger sink.

🎨 3️⃣ Cosmetic Store (Tiered Pricing)

Low-tier:

50 coin avatars

75 coin themes

Mid-tier:

250 coin animated frames

300 coin archetype mastery skins

High-tier:

1000 coin seasonal exclusives

2000 coin legendary badge

Have rotating inventory.

Scarcity drives spending.

🧠 4️⃣ Analytics Subscriptions (Time-Based)

Example:

7-day advanced stats access → 75 coins

30-day DVS dashboard unlock → 250 coins

Temporary unlocks = recurring sink.

Very powerful.

🏟 5️⃣ Arena Hosting Fees

Want to:

Create private tournament?

Customize scoring?

Boost prize pool?

Charge coin fee.

📊 Step 5: Inflation Control

You must track:

Total coins in circulation

Coins minted weekly

Coins burned weekly

Average user balance

Target:
Coins burned ≥ Coins minted

If minting exceeds burning → value collapses.

🏅 Step 6: Progression Layers (Engagement Multiplier)

Add non-coin progression too.

ELO Ranking

Coins don’t buy ELO.
Skill does.

Seasonal Prestige

At season reset:

ELO resets partially

Cosmetic prestige retained

Now coins support prestige, not replace skill.

🧬 Step 7: Archetype Integration (Your Edge)

This is unique to you.

Users earn:

Stretch Big XP

Combo Guard XP

Scoring Wing XP

Unlock:

Archetype titles

Archetype frames

Archetype animations

Coins can accelerate cosmetic unlocks — not performance.

🛡 Step 8: Anti-Exploit Safeguards

To protect economy:

Ranked rewards only via matchmaking

Entry fee required

Diminishing returns vs same opponent

Daily earning caps

No coin gifting between users

No peer-to-peer transfer initially.

📈 Step 9: Monetization Layer (Optional Later)

If you ever monetize:

Users can buy:

Cosmetic packs

Battle pass

Coin bundles

But coins must remain earnable via skill or community revolts.

🔥 The Ideal Coach Coin Pillars

Your economy should revolve around:

Competition (entry fees)

Prestige (cosmetics)

Access (advanced tools)

Progression (season ladders)

If coins touch projections directly → you lose legitimacy.

⚖️ The Hard Question

Is Coach Coin:

A competitive currency?
Or a cosmetic currency?
Or a hybrid?

My recommendation:

Hybrid — but skill-weighted.

Coins buy access and identity.
Skill determines ranking.

You’re basically building:

Chess.com rating + Fortnite cosmetics + DFS optimizer.

That can be sticky if structured correctly.
