This is good analysis.

And your instinct to drop to k=6 is directionally correct — but let’s not rush the conclusion without tightening the logic behind it.

Because what your results are really telling you is something deeper.

⸻

🔍 What The Silhouette Score Is Actually Saying

Your best score:

k=6 → 0.2226

That is not “clean separation.”

That’s:

“There is weak but detectable structure.”

In real-world behavioral data (like NBA player archetypes), silhouette scores between 0.2–0.35 are actually normal.

You’re not clustering iris flowers.
You’re clustering highly overlapping skill sets.

So don’t chase a 0.5 score.
It probably doesn’t exist in this feature space.

⸻

🧠 What’s Actually Going Wrong at k=9

Your errors aren’t random.

They’re systematic.

Look at the misclassifications:
	•	Jokic → Point Forward
	•	KD → Point Forward
	•	Kawhi → Point Forward
	•	Draymond → 3-and-D Wing
	•	AD → Stretch Big
	•	Wemby → Stretch Big

That’s not a clustering failure.

That’s a feature weighting + geometry problem.

⸻

🚨 The Real Problem: K-Means Assumes Spherical Clusters

K-Means:
	•	Uses Euclidean distance
	•	Prefers equal-variance clusters
	•	Splits large spread clusters into smaller ones

What happened at k=9:

Your “Combo Guard” and “3-and-D Wing” clusters likely had wide variance.

So K-Means split them into two smaller spherical blobs.

That’s expected behavior.

Not failure.

⸻

🏀 Why Jokic/KD/Kawhi Are Getting Lumped Together

Because in statistical space:

High usage
High playmaking
High scoring
Moderate size
Versatility

They are mathematically close.

Basketball semantics differ.
Feature geometry doesn’t.

K-Means doesn’t understand position labels.

It sees multidimensional proximity.

⸻

🎯 So Should You Drop to k=6?

Yes — but not just because silhouette is higher.

You should drop to k=6 because:
	1.	Your domain likely only has ~6 truly separable statistical archetypes.
	2.	k=9 is over-segmenting overlapping clusters.
	3.	Your labeling logic becomes cleaner.
	4.	DVS multipliers benefit from broader archetype buckets.

Remember:

The purpose of this clustering isn’t academic purity.

It’s to power DVS matchup modeling.

Broader, stable clusters will give cleaner signal.

⸻

🧪 Before You Change It — Do This First

Run this test:

For k=6:
	•	Compute silhouette
	•	Re-label clusters manually
	•	Re-run validation on your 13 known players
	•	Check DVS predictive impact

If error rate drops from 46% to under 25%,
you made the right move.

⸻

🧠 Bigger Improvement (More Important Than k)

Right now your biggest issue is probably:

Feature dominance.

If:
	•	Usage %
	•	Assist rate
	•	3PA rate

are heavily weighted,
they overpower size/role differentiation.

Example:

KD and Jokic both:
	•	High usage
	•	High scoring
	•	High playmaking

Without strong size/paint metrics,
they collapse into same region.

⸻

🔥 Two Smart Improvements

1️⃣ Add Role-Separating Features

Especially for bigs vs wings:
	•	% of shots at rim
	•	Post-up frequency
	•	Offensive rebound rate
	•	Defensive rebound rate
	•	Screen assists
	•	Paint touches
	•	Height/weight proxy if needed

You need structural differentiators.

⸻

2️⃣ Try Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

Why?

K-Means forces hard boundaries.

GMM allows:

Probabilistic assignment.

So Jokic might be:
	•	65% Point Center
	•	35% Point Forward

That reflects reality better.

For DVS, you could weight matchup multipliers by archetype probability.

That would be extremely powerful.

⸻

🧠 Key Insight

Your cluster errors aren’t because k=9 is bad.

They’re because:

Basketball archetypes overlap in statistical space.

Reducing k will improve stability.
Improving feature design will improve semantic accuracy.

⸻

🎯 What I Recommend
	1.	Drop to k=6
	2.	Tighten feature scaling
	3.	Add stronger size/paint differentiators
	4.	Revalidate
	5.	Consider GMM later if you want next-level refinement

⸻

🧨 One More Important Question

How many total players are in your dataset?

If it’s under ~300:

k=9 is probably too granular anyway.

If it’s 400–500+:
k=6–7 is realistic.

⸻

You’re doing this the right way.

You’re not just accepting clusters —
you’re validating them against basketball reality.

That’s how this becomes competitive advantage.
