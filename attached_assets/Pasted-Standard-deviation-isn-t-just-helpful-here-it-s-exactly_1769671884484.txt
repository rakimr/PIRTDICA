Standard deviation isn’t just helpful here, it’s exactly the right statistical lens.

What you just did is connect the intuition of “leash” to a measurable quantity. That’s the right move.

Let’s make it concrete.

⸻

Why standard deviation is the right signal

Think about what you’re trying to measure with the “star weight” \omega_i:

“How stable are this player’s minutes, game to game?”

That is literally what standard deviation measures.
	•	Low SD → coach plays them no matter what → high trust
	•	High SD → situational / fragile role → low trust

So yes, SD is the cleanest empirical proxy.

⸻

How SD plugs directly into the model

Step 1: Compute per-player minutes volatility

From historical games (ideally last 20–40):

\sigma_i = \operatorname{SD}(\text{Min}_{i,g})

⸻

Step 2: Normalize it against role volatility

We don’t want to punish players just because their role is volatile.

\sigma_{r_i} = \operatorname{SD}(\text{Min} \mid r_i)

⸻

Step 3: Convert SD → star weight

One simple, effective mapping:

\boxed{
\omega_i
=
\operatorname{clip}
\Big(
1 - \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_{r_i}},
\;\omega_{\min},\;\omega_{\max}
\Big)
}

Typical bounds:
	•	\omega_{\min} = 0.05
	•	\omega_{\max} = 0.80

⸻

Intuition check with real examples

Tyrese Maxey
	•	σᵢ ≈ 2.5
	•	σ_role ≈ 5.5

\omega \approx 1 - 2.5/5.5 \approx 0.55

(then bumped slightly for closing role)

⸻

Volatile bench guard
	•	σᵢ ≈ 8.0
	•	σ_role ≈ 6.0

\omega \approx 1 - 8/6 \approx -0.33 \rightarrow 0.05

Which is exactly what you want.

⸻

Why SD beats usage here

Usage can be:
	•	High but volatile (Jordan Clarkson)
	•	Low but stable (Mikal Bridges)

SD directly measures coach behavior, not player skill.

⸻

Optional refinement (very pro, very clean)

Use coefficient of variation instead:

\text{CV}_i = \frac{\sigma_i}{\bar{M}_i}

Then:

\omega_i = 1 - \frac{\text{CV}_i}{\text{CV}_{r_i}}

This makes the metric scale-free.

⸻

One more bonus: SD gives you distributions for free

Once you have σ:

\text{Min}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{M}_i, \sigma_i^2)

That’s:
	•	Ceiling
	•	Floor
	•	Volatility
	•	GPP leverage

All from one number.
