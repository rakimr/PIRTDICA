This is a very sharp instinct — and yes, the train of thought is absolutely valid.

You’re basically asking:

“Since salary already encodes expectation, should it also inform the range (floor/ceiling) of outcomes?”

Short answer:

✅ Yes conceptually
⚠️ But you have to be careful not to double count information
🔥 And this can be used very intelligently

Let’s break it down cleanly.

1️⃣ What salary actually represents

Salary is not random.

It’s the market’s estimate of:

𝐸
[
𝐹
𝑃
∣
𝑀
𝑖
𝑛
𝑢
𝑡
𝑒
𝑠
,
𝑈
𝑠
𝑎
𝑔
𝑒
,
𝑅
𝑜
𝑙
𝑒
,
𝑀
𝑎
𝑡
𝑐
ℎ
𝑢
𝑝
]
E[FP∣Minutes,Usage,Role,Matchup]

So when you project fantasy points using:

Minutes

Usage

Rates

You are already modeling the same signal salary was built from.

That means:

Salary and projection are highly correlated by design.

2️⃣ So are we already capturing it?

If your projection model is solid:

Minutes model

Usage adjustments

Efficiency baseline

Then yes — you’re implicitly capturing salary logic.

Because salary is just:

Projection
×
Market Adjustment
Projection×Market Adjustment

So adjusting mean projection again using salary would double count.

3️⃣ Where your idea becomes powerful

Not in the mean.

In the distribution shape.

This is the key.

Empirical truth in DFS:

Players in different salary tiers have different volatility profiles.

For example:

Salary Tier	Mean FP	Std Dev	Distribution Shape
$3k–4k	18–25	High relative	Skewed right
$5k–7k	28–38	Moderate	Normal-ish
$9k+	45–60	Lower relative	Stable with ceiling spikes

So instead of saying:

“Salary adjusts projection”

You say:

“Salary informs expected variance and tail behavior.”

That’s much cleaner.

4️⃣ Conceptual model

Instead of:

𝐹
𝑃
𝑖
∼
𝑁
(
𝜇
𝑖
,
𝜎
𝑖
)
FP
i
	​

∼N(μ
i
	​

,σ
i
	​

)

You model:

𝜎
𝑖
=
𝑓
(
𝜇
𝑖
,
𝑆
𝑎
𝑙
𝑎
𝑟
𝑦
𝑖
)
σ
i
	​

=f(μ
i
	​

,Salary
i
	​

)

Or even:

𝜎
𝑖
=
𝛼
𝜇
𝑖
+
𝛽
⋅
𝑇
𝑖
𝑒
𝑟
𝑉
𝑜
𝑙
𝑎
𝑡
𝑖
𝑙
𝑖
𝑡
𝑦
σ
i
	​

=αμ
i
	​

+β⋅TierVolatility

Because historically:

Cheap players → more fragile minutes → higher σ

Mid-tier → most unstable

Superstars → heavy minutes floor

5️⃣ Salary-based floor/ceiling bands (your idea formalized)

You could empirically compute:

For each salary bucket:

10th percentile FP

90th percentile FP

Std dev

Example:

$4k players historically:

10th pct = 12 FP

90th pct = 36 FP

$10k players:

10th pct = 38 FP

90th pct = 75 FP

Then instead of assuming:

𝐶
𝑒
𝑖
𝑙
𝑖
𝑛
𝑔
=
𝜇
+
1.5
𝜎
Ceiling=μ+1.5σ

You could shrink/expand based on historical tier data.

This prevents unrealistic tails.

6️⃣ When this is most useful
Large slates

You care about:

Tail behavior

Relative ceiling

Ownership leverage

Salary-tier variance modeling helps here.

Ownership modeling

Public ownership strongly clusters by:

Salary tier

Value multiplier (5x, 6x talk)

So salary-tier expectations help estimate chalk.

7️⃣ The danger (important)

If you use salary to adjust:

Mean projection

Minutes

AND variance

You can accidentally make your model:

Too conservative

Too close to market

Reduce edge

Because salary already reflects public sentiment.

8️⃣ The cleaner way to integrate salary

Instead of adjusting μ:

Use salary to:

A) Regularize variance
𝜎
𝑖
=
𝜎
𝑖
⋅
𝑔
(
SalaryTier
)
σ
i
	​

=σ
i
	​

⋅g(SalaryTier)
B) Cap unrealistic tails

Prevent:

$3k player projecting 55 FP ceiling

$11k player having absurdly low floor

C) Detect mispricing

Compare:

𝜇
𝑖
𝑆
𝑎
𝑙
𝑎
𝑟
𝑦
𝑖
Salary
i
	​

μ
i
	​

	​


to historical tier averages.

This identifies actual value.

9️⃣ Are sharp players already doing this?

Yes — but indirectly.

Advanced optimizers often:

Use empirical distributions by salary tier

Run simulations using salary-conditioned variance

Penalize unrealistic outcomes

You’re thinking along the same lines.

🔟 Big-picture answer

Your idea makes sense.

But:

Salary should not move the mean projection.

Salary should shape the uncertainty distribution.

That’s the mathematically clean integration.
