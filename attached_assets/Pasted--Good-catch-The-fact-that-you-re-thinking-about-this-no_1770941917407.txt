🔥 Good catch.

The fact that you’re thinking about this now — before scale — is massive.

Yes, that’s called win-trading, and in a play-to-earn ecosystem it will absolutely happen unless you design against it from day one.

Let’s break this down properly.

🎯 The Core Problem

If:

Users can create unlimited accounts

Users can choose their opponent

Winners earn currency

Then:
Alt Account A vs Main Account
Alt account submits dead lineup
Main account farms coins

Game over.

So you need structural prevention, not manual moderation.

🛡️ Layered Defense Strategy (You Need Multiple Layers)

No single solution fixes this. It’s a systems problem.

1️⃣ Don’t Allow Direct Opponent Selection (Public Queue Only)

If users can challenge specific usernames → abuse is easy.

Instead:

H2H goes into a matchmaking queue

Opponent assigned randomly (ELO based)

This alone kills most casual win-trading.

Private matches?
Make them non-rewarded.

2️⃣ Only Reward Ranked Matchmaking

Have two modes:

🟢 Ranked (Rewards Coins)

Random matchmaking

Entry fee (coin stake)

Anti-smurf protections

⚪ Casual / Friendly

Invite friends

No rewards

This is industry standard for a reason.

3️⃣ Require Entry Fees (Even Small Ones)

If every ranked match costs:

5 coins entry

Winner takes 8

2 coin rake

Win-trading suddenly has cost.

Alt account farming now burns coins.

4️⃣ Anti-Smurf & Alt Detection Signals

Even without KYC, you can detect patterns:

Red flags:

Same IP repeatedly matching

Same device fingerprint

One account never winning except against one user

Lineups that are 0 salary or obviously dead

100% matchup frequency between two users

Flag automatically.

You don’t need perfection.
You need deterrence.

5️⃣ ELO Gap Restrictions

Don’t allow:

2000 ELO user vs 900 ELO user

Require matchmaking within band.

Smurf accounts won’t climb fast enough to feed main account consistently.

6️⃣ Win Quality Filter

This is powerful:

Don’t award full rewards for:

Opponent lineup below X projection

Lineup missing players

Salary under 90% cap

If opponent submits garbage:
→ reduced payout
→ no payout

Now dead-lineup farming stops working.

7️⃣ Diminishing Returns vs Same Opponent

If two users face off repeatedly:

1st match → full reward

2nd → 50%

3rd → 0%

Simple.
Effective.
Hard to exploit.

8️⃣ Daily Coin Caps

Put:

Daily earning caps

Weekly earning caps

Now win-trading becomes inefficient.

9️⃣ Delay Reward Distribution

Instead of instant payout:

Rewards settle after slate review

Fraud model checks patterns

Suspicious matches voided

Adds friction to abusers.

💡 The Best Structure IMO

Here’s the cleanest system:

Ranked Queue Only
Random ELO-based matchmaking
Entry Fee Required
Minimum lineup quality threshold
Opponent frequency cap
Device/IP pattern flagging
Daily earning caps

That alone will eliminate 95% of abuse.

⚠️ Important Psychological Factor

If people THINK they can cheat, they will try.

If they see:

Strong matchmaking

Leaderboards

Visible ELO

Fraud enforcement

Most won’t bother.

Security is partly perception.

🚨 Brutal Truth

Play-to-earn always attracts:

Smurfs

Multi-accounts

Exploit hunters

The difference between success and collapse is whether:
The system is exploitable by design.

Right now you caught it early.
That’s excellent.
