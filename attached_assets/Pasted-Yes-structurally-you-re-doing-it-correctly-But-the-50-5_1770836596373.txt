Yes — structurally you’re doing it correctly.

But the 50/50 blend is where the edge either compounds… or gets diluted.

Let’s break this down carefully.

1️⃣ Is Your DVA Implementation Conceptually Correct?

You’re doing:

Assign each player → Archetype

Calculate defense performance vs archetype

Convert to % boost/penalty

Apply multiplier to projection

Blend with traditional DVP

That framework is absolutely sound.

Example:

Stretch Big vs WAS → +18.6%

Traditional Big vs NYK → -16.5%

That’s exactly how it should behave.

The key thing to confirm:

Are those percentages relative to league average per minute?

If yes → good.
If not → fix that immediately.

Because raw FP allowed is pace polluted.

2️⃣ The 50/50 Blend — Is That Optimal?

This is where things get interesting.

Right now you're doing:

Adjusted Projection = Base Projection × (1 + 0.5 × DVP + 0.5 × DVS)

That’s conservative.

Which is good early.

But here's the real question:

Is DVS correlated with DVP?

If they’re highly correlated:
You’re double counting signal.

If they’re weakly correlated:
You’re combining orthogonal edges (very good).

You need to measure:

Correlation(DVP multiplier, DVS multiplier)

If correlation > 0.6
→ blending is mostly redundancy.

If correlation < 0.3
→ your archetype system is genuinely adding new information.

That’s the first validation test.

3️⃣ Are You Using the Right Baseline?

Very important question:

Is your base projection already incorporating defensive effects implicitly?

Because if your base projection:

Uses rolling averages

Includes opponent adjustments

Or pulls from Vegas totals

Then layering DVP + DVS may be triple stacking defense.

Sometimes the cleanest system is:

Base projection = pure player rate × minutes
Then defensive multipliers adjust.

4️⃣ Is +18.6% Too Large?

This matters.

An 18.6% boost is massive in DFS.

Example:
30 FP projection
→ +18.6%
→ 35.6 FP

That’s slate-breaking territory.

Before trusting numbers that large, check:

What’s the standard deviation of your DVS multipliers?

What’s the 95th percentile?

How stable are they week over week?

If the system produces lots of 15–20% swings,
you may need shrinkage toward league average.

5️⃣ The Real Question: Should You Even Blend?

Here’s something most people miss:

DVP is positional.
DVS is stat-profile driven.

If your archetypes are good, DVS should dominate DVP.

Long-term ideal structure:

Early season:
70% DVP
30% DVS

Mid season:
50 / 50

Late season:
30% DVP
70% DVS

Because archetype data becomes more stable over time.

6️⃣ The Bigger Strategic Question

Right now you're applying DVS as a projection modifier.

But the real edge in GPP isn't projection.

It’s ceiling asymmetry.

Instead of boosting median projection,
you may get more edge by:

Increasing ceiling projection

Increasing volatility range

Flagging “matchup spike candidates”

Example:

Stretch Big vs WAS (+18.6%)
Maybe you don’t boost median 18%.
Maybe you:

Boost ceiling 25%

Boost 90th percentile outcome

Increase ownership leverage score

That’s where this becomes elite-level DFS modeling.

7️⃣ Here's How I'd Stress-Test It

Do a backtest:

For last 30 slates:

Compare:

Raw projection

Projection + DVP

Projection + DVS

Projection + blended

Measure:

RMSE

Mean absolute error

% of players beating salary expectation

% of players hitting 6x+

You’ll know quickly which layer actually adds signal.

8️⃣ Blunt Assessment

What you’ve built is sharp.

But the real question is:

Is it predictive…
or just descriptive?

If the multipliers are derived from full-season data,
you may be modeling past noise.

You want rolling defensive windows (last 30 days ideally).
