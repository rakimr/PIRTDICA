Now you’re thinking like a game designer instead of just a feature builder.

Yes — splitting into Coach Coin and Coach Cash can be extremely powerful.

But only if you define them very clearly and never let them blur.

Let’s architect this cleanly.

🪙 Coach Coin vs 💵 Coach Cash

You’re essentially separating:

Soft currency (engagement currency)

Hard currency (competitive currency)

That’s how most successful game economies are structured.

🪙 Coach Coin (Soft Currency)

Earned through:

Playing ranked

Daily challenges

Achievements

Season rewards

Spent on:

Cosmetics

Profile themes

Archetype badges

Animations

Seasonal unlocks

Limited edition drops

Coach Coin = Identity + Status

It should NOT:

Enter staking pools

Be transferable

Be convertible to cash

This prevents abuse.

💵 Coach Cash (Hard Currency)

This is where things get serious.

Coach Cash should be:

Used for entry fees in competitive matches

Used in tournaments

Used for staking H2H contests

Potentially withdrawable (if you ever go that route)

Coach Cash = Competitive fuel

Why This Split Is Powerful

If you keep one hybrid currency:

Win-trading affects everything.
Inflation affects everything.
Monetization affects everything.

By separating:

Coach Coin economy = engagement loop
Coach Cash economy = competitive loop

Now you can tune each independently.

🧠 The Smart Structure
Ranked Modes
🟢 Coin Mode (Free Play Ladder)

Entry: 0 Coach Cash

Earn Coach Coins

Cosmetic rewards

ELO ranking

Low stakes. Low risk. High engagement.

🔥 Cash Mode (Competitive Arena)

Entry fee in Coach Cash

Winner takes % of pot

Small platform rake

Strict anti-cheat

Serious competition.

🚨 Important Legal Note

If Coach Cash:

Is purchased

Is staked

Is withdrawable

You’re entering real-money gaming territory.

That changes compliance requirements.

If Coach Cash is NOT withdrawable and only used in-app:
Much safer structurally.

⚖️ Best Hybrid Model (If You Want Controlled Risk)

Coach Cash:

Can be purchased

Can be earned in small amounts

Cannot be withdrawn

Used for high-tier contests

That keeps you out of full gambling territory.

🏦 How Coins & Cash Interact (Careful Here)

Do NOT allow:
Coach Coin → Coach Cash conversion

That creates farming exploits.

You MAY allow:
Coach Cash → Coach Coin conversion
(at bad exchange rate)

Why?

Cash buyers can get cosmetics.
Grinders cannot farm cash.

🔄 The Full Loop

User starts:

Plays free ranked

Earns Coach Coins

Unlocks identity

Gets competitive:

Buys or earns Coach Cash

Enters cash arena

Wins bigger stakes

Climbs prestige ladder

Two parallel economies.

🎯 The Hidden Advantage

This also solves your win-trading issue partially.

If:
Cash matches require:

Entry fee

ELO matching

Quality lineup validation

Win-trading becomes expensive.

🧬 Where This Gets Really Powerful For You

You already built:

Archetypes

DVA/DVS engine

Advanced analytics

Imagine:

Coach Cash Arena:
“Archetype Specialist Tournament”
Only Scoring Wings count.
$50 Coach Cash entry.

Now your data model becomes a competitive theme engine.

🚫 What You Must Avoid

Letting Coach Coin influence Cash matches

Letting Cash buy projection boosts

Letting Coin convert to Cash

Printing too much Coach Cash

Hard currency must feel scarce.

🏗 Clean Structure Summary

Coach Coin:
Engagement currency
Cosmetics + XP + themes

Coach Cash:
Competitive entry currency
Used for staking
High integrity

Separate wallets.
Separate ledgers.
Separate inflation controls.

This structure scales.
