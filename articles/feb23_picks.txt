n Jr., and Desmond Bane. Sacramento is without Domantas Sabonis and Dejounte Murray. Utah has Lauri Markkanen sidelined. That is a lot of production removed from three rosters, and someone has to absorb it.

Here are four players whose numbers should spike tonight, which stats you should be watching, and why the matchup data backs it up. If you are betting props tonight, these are the edges worth your attention.


TY JEROME: Points and Assists vs Sacramento

MEM vs SAC | Point Guard | 3-and-D Wing

Monitor his status. Jerome is listed questionable with an illness. If he plays, this is the best matchup on the board tonight.

Jerome averages 17.7 points and 6.8 assists per game this season, but those numbers come in a limited sample (14.6% of games played). His per 100 possessions rates tell the real story: he produces at a rate that belongs in a different tier entirely. His usage rate of 32.9% is higher than Kevin Durant and DeMar DeRozan tonight, meaning when he is on the floor, Memphis runs its offense through him.

With Morant, Jackson, and Bane all sidelined, Jerome is the PG1 with 38+ projected minutes. That is not a typical backup getting spot minutes. That is a player being handed the keys to the entire operation.

Now layer in the matchup. Sacramento is also depleted, missing Sabonis and Murray, two players who anchor both ends of the floor. The DVA data shows Sacramento allows a +0.031 points per minute differential to 3-and-D Wings, Jerome's archetype classification. That is not a general positional weakness. It is a specific vulnerability to the type of player Jerome is.

His matchup history confirms it. In his one game against Sacramento this season, Jerome's per minute production spiked 21.5% above his season average. That game came before the Murray and Sabonis injuries stripped Sacramento's roster even further.

His shot chart explains the mechanism. 49.3% of his field goal attempts are threes, with nearly all of them coming from above the break (34 of 35 three point attempts). Sacramento allows a 35.9% clip from above the break and a 51.1% paint field goal percentage. Jerome attacks both zones. He spaces the floor like a wing but handles the ball like a point guard, and Sacramento does not have the personnel to cover both.

The stat to watch: Points is your primary call. His per game average reflects limited minutes, not limited production. With 38+ minutes against a defense missing its two best players, expect scoring well above his season line. Assists are the secondary angle. Memphis has no other primary creator on the roster, so every possession runs through Jerome. If you are stacking props on one player tonight, this is your best candidate, if he plays.


DE'AARON FOX: Steals and Scoring in His New Home

SA vs DET | Point Guard | Playmaker

Fox landed in San Antonio at the trade deadline, and the books are still catching up. His per game averages reflect a player adjusting to a new system. His per 100 possessions numbers reflect what he actually does: 29.9 points, 8.8 assists, 1.8 steals. That is a franchise player rate.

Fox is San Antonio's PG1 with 32+ projected minutes, slotting in ahead of Dylan Harper and Stephon Castle. He is their primary ball handler and lead scorer. The integration period is over. This is his team now.

The matchup against Detroit has a specific, measurable angle. The targeted stat analysis shows Detroit gives up +1.2 extra points in steals to opposing point guards compared to league average. Fox averages 1.2 steals per game on the season, but his per 100 rate of 1.8 shows the production scales with opportunity. Detroit's ball handling in the halfcourt creates the loose ball situations Fox thrives in.

His shot creation data explains why the scoring upside is real. 45.4% of Fox's field goal attempts are pull ups. He creates his own shot at one of the highest rates among point guards in the league. His rim and paint percentage sits at 47.8%, meaning nearly half his attempts come at the basket. Detroit allows a 63.1% field goal rate at the restricted area and 43.8% in the non-restricted paint. Those are not elite defensive marks.

Playing alongside Wembanyama changes his offensive environment. Wembanyama is a Stretch 5 who takes 30.7% of his attempts from three, which pulls Detroit's center away from the rim and opens driving lanes for Fox. When a 7'4" center is demanding defensive attention at the perimeter, the paint opens up. Fox is built to exploit exactly that kind of space.

His prop line for points sits at 16.5. His season average is 19.3 points per game. That is already a 17% edge over the line before you account for the new role as San Antonio's primary scorer and the Detroit matchup.

The stat to watch: Points over 16.5 is the cleanest call. His pull up heavy game and rim attacking style match up against a Detroit interior defense that does not close driving lanes effectively. Steals are the secondary angle. Detroit's +1.2 positional edge to opposing point guards combined with Fox's active hands makes 1+ steals a reasonable expectation.


OLIVIER-MAXENCE PROSPER: Rebounds and Scoring in an Expanded Role

MEM vs SAC | Power Forward | 3-and-D Wing

Prosper is a player most people have not watched closely this season. He averages 6.5 points and 2.9 rebounds per game. Those are rotation player numbers. But Memphis' injury crisis has changed his role completely.

With Morant, Jackson, and Bane all out, Prosper is now playing across three positions: SF, PF, and C in different lineup configurations. The model projects him for 35+ minutes tonight, nearly triple the role his current stat line implies. That minute jump is where the edge lives.

His per 100 possessions rates confirm there is production underneath the low averages: 20.7 points, 9.6 rebounds, 3.0 assists. Those are starter-level rates. He has just never had the minutes to express them consistently. Tonight, he gets those minutes.

His shot chart is the key to understanding why those rates translate. 44.4% of his field goal attempts are threes, with an unusual distribution: 29 of his 55 three point attempts this season come from the corners. Corner threes are the most efficient shot in basketball, and Prosper hunts them. His rim and paint percentage of 53.2% means the rest of his game lives at the basket. He barely takes midrange shots at all (2.4%). It is a binary attack: either a corner three or a finish at the rim. That profile is efficient and scales with minutes.

Sacramento's archetype data gives up a +0.031 per minute differential to 3-and-D Wings. Over 35+ minutes, that is roughly 1.1 extra points from the matchup alone. Sacramento's paint field goal percentage (51.1%) and above the break three defense (35.9%) both leak enough to feed Prosper's shot diet. And without Sabonis anchoring the interior, Sacramento's rim protection drops significantly.

The stat to watch: Rebounds are your call here. His per 100 rebound rate of 9.6 means he crashes the glass aggressively, and Sacramento without Sabonis has lost its best interior rebounder. In 35+ minutes against a team that cannot rebound, expect his boards to clear any reasonable line. If his scoring props appear on the books, those are worth a look too. A player with 20.7 points per 100 possessions in 35+ minutes should produce well above his 6.5 per game average.


PAUL REED: Blocks and Rebounds as a Tournament Swing

DET vs SA | Center | Traditional Big

Reed is Detroit's third center behind Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart. In most games, that means limited minutes. Tonight, the matchup data says his minutes could expand, and when they do, the production rate is explosive.

His per 100 possessions profile is remarkable: 22.6 points, 17.3 rebounds, 3.5 steals, 2.4 blocks. That steal and block rate combination is unusual for a center. He is not just a rebounder and rim protector. He generates turnovers at a rate that creates extra possessions, and those translate to transition opportunities.

San Antonio's DVA data is where this play gets interesting. The Spurs give up a +0.111 per minute differential to Traditional Bigs, the highest vulnerability to any archetype among tonight's defenses. That DVS multiplier of 5.69 confirms this is a statistically significant edge, not noise. San Antonio's defense struggles specifically against players who play the way Reed plays: interior focused, rebounding heavy, physically active.

His shot chart shows a pure interior finisher. 77.2% of his field goal attempts come at the rim or in the paint. He has the highest restricted area attempt rate (50.3%) among all players we are analyzing tonight. He does not need the offense to create shots for him. He gets his own through offensive rebounding, rim runs, and put backs.

Playing alongside Cade Cunningham benefits Reed's profile directly. Cunningham is a Playmaker with a 30.9% usage rate who generates driving opportunities that collapse the defense toward the ball. When that happens, Reed gets easy finishes at the rim on the weak side. Cunningham's 41.3% pull up rate means he is creating these driving situations constantly.

The risk here is minutes. Reed is the third center on the depth chart, and his playing time depends on game flow and foul trouble at the position. This is not a reliable every night play. But the rate stats and the archetype matchup say that if the minutes come, the production follows.

The stat to watch: Blocks are the primary angle. His per 100 block rate of 2.4 against a defense that hemorrhages production to Traditional Bigs creates genuine upside. Rebounds are the secondary call. His 17.3 per 100 rebound rate means any extended stretch on the court should produce boards. If Detroit gets into a tight game and needs physicality against Wembanyama, Reed is the body they send in, and San Antonio's defense is the one that feeds his stat profile.


THE BIGGER PICTURE

This is a slate defined by absence. Memphis, Sacramento, and Utah are all missing cornerstone players, and the production those players would have generated does not disappear. It gets redistributed. The question is always where.

Jerome and Prosper are the clearest beneficiaries. Memphis has removed three players who combined for roughly 60+ points, 20+ rebounds, and 15+ assists per game. That volume has to go somewhere, and the depth chart says it goes through Jerome (ball handling, scoring, assists) and Prosper (rebounding, corner shooting, rim finishing). Sacramento's parallel injuries make this even more exploitable because the defense they face is also weakened.

Fox is a pricing error. A player with per 100 rates of 29.9 points and 8.8 assists in a new role alongside a generational talent in Wembanyama. The books have not caught up because the sample size in San Antonio is small. But the underlying production rate is the same player who was an All-Star caliber point guard in Sacramento.

Reed is the swing. His rate stats against San Antonio's archetype vulnerability create the highest per minute upside among any player in this analysis, but the minutes have to materialize.

Every pick here follows the same approach: start with what the defense gives up, match it to the player's actual shot profile and archetype, factor in the teammates who create opportunities, and find the stat most likely to exceed its line. You can apply this framework to any game on any night.

We are building analytics tools at PIRTDICA that make this kind of breakdown accessible to everyone. More on that soon.

Tonight's matchups reward the specific over the general. If you are betting tonight, look past the averages, look at the matchup, and find the edge.
