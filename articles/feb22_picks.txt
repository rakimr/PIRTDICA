4 Players With Real Stat Edges Tonight (Feb 22)

---

Tonight's slate is loaded with soft matchups, but not all of them are obvious. Three of the four worst defenses in the league are on the board: Portland, Washington, and Chicago. The data says they leak production in specific, measurable ways. Not just "bad defense" in a general sense, but vulnerabilities tied to specific stats that show up in shot charts, archetype matchups, and positional breakdowns.

Here are four players whose numbers should spike tonight, which stats you should be watching, and why the matchup data backs it up. If you are betting props tonight, these are the edges worth your attention.


MARK WILLIAMS: Points and Blocks vs Portland

PHO vs POR | Center | Traditional Big

Mark Williams averages 12.1 points and 0.9 blocks per game this season. Tonight, both of those numbers have room to jump.

Portland is the worst team in the league at defending center blocks. They allow 2.9 blocks per game to opposing centers, 48.5% above league average. Williams may only average 0.9 blocks on the season, but his per 100 possessions rate (2.0 BLK) shows he generates them when the opportunity is there. Portland gives him that opportunity.

On the scoring side, Portland surrenders 24.9 points per game to centers. League average is 21.5. That is a 15.8% edge at the position. Williams' archetype level data is even more telling: Portland gives up an extra +0.088 points per minute to Traditional Bigs specifically, not just centers as a position group, but players who fit Williams' exact profile.

His shot chart explains why this matchup is so exploitable. 96.7% of his field goal attempts come at the rim or in the paint. He does not shoot threes. He does not take midrange jumpers. He is a pure interior finisher, and Portland allows a 67.8% field goal rate at the restricted area, one of the worst marks in the league.

His teammates matter here too. Devin Booker and Grayson Allen (both perimeter creators) draw defensive attention to the outside, which opens driving lanes and interior passing windows. Williams leads Phoenix in screen assists per 48 minutes (5.19), meaning he is constantly involved in pick and roll actions that create his own looks at the rim. When the guards attack and Portland's interior defense collapses, Williams is the one finishing.

His prop line for points sits at 11.5. His adjusted projection, accounting for archetype matchup and defensive weakness, pushes him to 14.9. That is a 30% edge over the book's number.

The stat to watch: If you are looking at Williams tonight, points over 11.5 is the strongest play. Blocks are a bonus, but harder to project in small samples. The scoring volume against a porous interior defense is the cleaner angle.


LAMELO BALL: Scoring Volume vs Washington

CHA vs WAS | Point Guard | Playmaker

LaMelo Ball averages 19.3 points, 7.4 assists, and 3.4 threes per game this season, but those numbers are suppressed by a 27.6 minute per game average. His per 100 possessions rates tell the real story: 34.3 points, 13.7 assists, 2.1 steals. On a per minute basis, he is one of the most productive players in the league.

Tonight he is projected for 38+ minutes against Washington. That is a 38% jump in court time, and it matters because his production scales linearly with opportunity. More minutes, more touches, more shots.

Now layer in the matchup. Washington has the worst defense in the league. Their shot chart data shows they allow opponents to shoot 68.2% at the restricted area and 35.6% from above the break on threes. They cannot protect the rim and they cannot close out on the perimeter.

LaMelo's shot profile is built to exploit both weaknesses. 55.9% of his field goal attempts are three pointers, and he creates nearly half of them off the dribble (40.7% pull up rate). He does not need screens set for him. He does not need the offense to generate looks. He pulls up in transition, he pulls up in the halfcourt, and Washington does not have the personnel to contest.

His Charlotte teammates reinforce this. Brandon Miller (Scoring Wing) and Coby White (Combo Guard) are both secondary creators who can handle the ball when LaMelo sits, which means when he is on the floor, he is not sharing possessions with another high usage playmaker. His 31.9% usage rate reflects that. He is THE engine.

The stat to watch: Points is your primary call. With 38+ minutes against the league's worst defense and a pull up heavy shot diet, expect scoring in the mid 20s. His assists should climb with the extra minutes too (7.4 per game average in 27.6 minutes scales to roughly 10+ in 38 minutes), but the scoring volume is the sharper edge because Washington's defense collapses everywhere.

His three point prop sits at 3.5 across multiple books. He averages 3.4 per game in restricted minutes. With 38% more court time and no defensive resistance from above the break, that number should clear comfortably. If you are stacking props on one player tonight, LaMelo in this matchup is your best candidate.


JALEN GREEN: Points in a New Role vs Portland

PHO vs POR | Shooting Guard | Combo Guard

Green is only 7 games into his Phoenix tenure, and the books have not caught up. His per game averages (11.1 PPG in 15.3 MPG) reflect a player still being integrated. His per 100 possessions numbers (42.4 PTS, 7.2 AST) reflect what he actually does when he touches the ball.

That gap is the story. Green's 34.1% usage rate is enormous, meaning when he is on the court, Phoenix runs a significant portion of its offense through him. He plays alongside Devin Booker (Combo Guard), which creates a two headed scoring backcourt that forces defenses to pick their poison.

His shot chart shows a perimeter oriented scorer: 56.1% of his attempts are threes, with 40.9% of all his shots coming off pull ups. He creates his own shot at a high rate and does not rely on catch and shoot opportunities to get going.

Portland's defense feeds directly into this profile. They allow opposing shooting guards to generate steals at a 34.5% clip above league average, which means the passing lanes are loose and the ball handling is careless. For a player with Green's hands and court awareness, that translates to extra possessions and transition opportunities.

On the scoring front, Portland's archetype data against Combo Guards shows a +0.046 points per minute edge. Over 36+ projected minutes, that is roughly 1.6 extra points just from the matchup itself, before you account for pace and defensive scheme.

The stat to watch: Points is your primary call here. His per game average of 11.1 is misleading because of limited minutes. In the minutes he has played, he scores at an elite rate. With 36+ minutes tonight against a defense that leaks production to his archetype, expect scoring well above his per game average. His point props range from 11.5 to 24.5 across different books, a sign of genuine market uncertainty about his new role. If you catch the lower end of that range, take it seriously.

Steals are the secondary angle. Portland's vulnerability to guard steals combined with Green's active hands makes 1+ steals a reasonable expectation tonight.


OG ANUNOBY: Points Through Scheme vs Chicago

NY vs CHI | Power Forward | Stretch 4

OG Anunoby averages 16.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game this season. His scoring is the stat most likely to spike tonight, and the reason comes down to how Chicago defends and how New York creates shots for him.

Chicago gives up 27.3 points per game to opposing power forwards. League average is 22.9. That is a 19.4% edge at the position. They also allow a 37.0% three point rate from above the break, which is bottom tier in the league.

OG's shot chart is a two level attack: 46.1% of his attempts are threes and 48.5% come at the rim or in the paint. He barely takes midrange shots (5.4%). He either catches and shoots from deep or finishes at the basket. Chicago's defense leaks in both of those zones.

The key detail is how those threes get created. 81.9% of OG's three point attempts are catch and shoot. He is not pulling up off the dribble. He is moving without the ball, relocating to the corners (he takes 123 corner threes this season vs 107 above the break), and waiting for Jalen Brunson to find him.

That matters because Brunson, a Combo Guard with elite playmaking instincts, runs New York's offense. Karl-Anthony Towns (Stretch 5) spaces the floor from the center position, pulling Chicago's bigs away from the rim. This opens driving lanes for Brunson, which creates the kick out opportunities OG lives on.

Chicago's rim defense allows 65.7% shooting at the restricted area, which also benefits OG's paint finishing. When the three is not there, he attacks the basket (44.5% of his shots come in the paint), and Chicago does not have the interior presence to deter him.

His hustle numbers add context: 4.12 deflections per 48 minutes and 1.7 steals per game show a player who generates extra possessions on the defensive end, which feeds transition scoring opportunities.

The stat to watch: If you are looking at OG tonight, points over 14.5 is your call. His 16.6 per game average already clears it, and the matchup data suggests he will be at or above that number tonight. Chicago gives up the largest positional scoring edge on this entire slate, allowing 19.4% more points to power forwards than league average. His catch and shoot heavy profile, combined with Brunson's playmaking and Towns' floor spacing, creates a clean offensive environment that you can trust.


THE BIGGER PICTURE

Portland shows up twice. Washington once. Chicago once. Three of the four worst defenses in the league, and the data confirms they leak production in specific, measurable ways. Not just overall, but to specific positions and player types.

That is the difference between "this team is bad" and "this team gives up blocks to centers at a 48.5% rate above average." One is a narrative. The other is an edge you can build around.

Every pick here follows the same approach: start with what the defense gives up, match it to the player's actual shot profile and archetype, factor in the teammates who create opportunities, and find the stat most likely to exceed its average. You can apply this framework to any game on any night.

We are building analytics tools at PIRTDICA that make this kind of breakdown accessible to everyone. More on that soon.

Tonight's matchups reward the specific over the general. If you are betting tonight, look past the averages, look at the matchup, and find the edge.
