4 NBA DFS Plays the Market Is Sleeping On Tonight (Feb 22)

---

Tonight's slate has traps everywhere. High-owned stars in bad spots. Cheap guys in great spots that nobody's talking about.

You could scroll through rankings and hope for the best. Or you could look at what the matchup data is actually telling you — defense vs. archetype edges, stat-specific vulnerabilities, projected ownership — and build from there.

We found four plays that stand out. Two are near-invisible on the ownership radar. One is chalk for good reason. And one is a sneaky leverage play hiding in plain sight.

Let's get into it.

MARK WILLIAMS — The Zero-Percent Smash Play

PHO vs POR | C | $5,800

This is the play of the slate, and somehow nobody is rostering him.

Mark Williams projects for 41.6 fantasy points tonight. His season average? 27.8. That's a 50% spike — and it's not wishful thinking, it's math.

Portland is the worst team in the league at defending center blocks. Not bottom-five. The worst. Centers see a +48.5% edge in blocks against them. Williams also gets a +15.8% edge in points at the position.

Here's where it gets interesting. Traditional DVP (defense vs. position) only tells you part of the story. When you look at Defense vs. Archetype — how Portland defends Williams' specific player type, a Traditional Big — you see a +0.138 FP/min advantage. Over 29 projected minutes, that edge stacks up fast.

The kicker: projected ownership is 0%. Zero. Nobody is on this guy.

At $5,800, he's returning 7.18x projected value — one of the best ratios on the entire slate. Ceiling of 60. Floor of 29.

If you're building lineups tonight and Mark Williams isn't in most of them, you're leaving money on the table.

LAMELO BALL — Chalk, But Justified

CHA vs WAS | PG | $8,400

Yes, he'll be popular. 34% projected ownership. That's chalk territory.

But sometimes chalk is chalk because the play is that obvious — and fading it is the mistake.

LaMelo projects for 60 fantasy points tonight against Washington. His season average is 36.7. That's a 63% jump. His ceiling? 81.

Washington has the worst defense in the league. Full stop. LaMelo's DVP matchup grades at 1.062, meaning the position itself gets a 6.2% boost. Add in his 31.9% usage rate and 38+ projected minutes, and this is a slate-breaker.

At $8,400 he's returning 7.14x projected value. For a player this expensive, that ratio is absurd.

The play here isn't to fade LaMelo. It's to pair him with low-owned guys (like Williams) so your lineup is differentiated everywhere else. You eat the chalk at PG, then gain leverage at every other position.

JALEN GREEN — The Quiet Heist in Phoenix

PHO vs POR | SG | $6,200

Green is in a new situation this season, and the market hasn't caught up.

He projects for 40.9 fantasy points — nearly double his 22.0 season average. That's the biggest percentage spike of any player on this slate.

Why? Portland again. The Trail Blazers bleed steals to opposing guards at a +34.5% clip above league average. Green's 34.1% usage rate means he's touching the ball constantly, and Portland's overall DVP for his position grades at 1.077.

Ownership sits at 9.5% — moderate territory. Not contrarian, but far from overexposed. At $6,200, his 6.59x value ratio gives you elite upside without eating your salary cap.

Ceiling: 63.3. In a Portland matchup. At that price. You see where this is going.

OG ANUNOBY — The Targeted Matchup Edge

NY vs CHI | PF | $6,600

This one's different. It's not a projection spike — it's a stat-specific vulnerability.

Chicago gives up +4.4 extra fantasy points in scoring to power forwards. That's a 19.4% edge above league average. They also allow +0.6 FP in rebounds to the position.

OG has been playing heavy power forward minutes this season, and his defensive versatility keeps him on the floor. If you're targeting props tonight, this is the kind of stat-specific edge that translates directly — Chicago isn't just bad at defense, they're bad at defending his position in the exact categories where he produces.

At 0% projected ownership, he's completely off the radar. His ceiling of 43.5 won't win you a GPP alone, but in cash games or as a contrarian roster piece, the matchup data is on your side.

THE BIGGER PICTURE

Notice a pattern?

Portland shows up twice. Washington once. Chicago once. Three of the four worst defenses in the league, and the data confirms they leak production in specific, measurable ways — not just overall, but to specific positions and player types.

That's the difference between "this team is bad" and "this team gives up blocks to centers at a 48.5% rate above average." One is a narrative. The other is an edge you can build around.

If you're just looking at salary and season averages, you're playing a different game than the people who are winning. The best DFS players chase matchups — position-level, archetype-level, stat-level — and they measure those matchups with precision.

We're building tools at PIRTDICA to make that kind of analysis accessible to everyone. More on that soon.

Tonight's slate rewards the approach. Build accordingly.
